# PYMathematics
Dummy project that demonstrates advanced Linear Algebra in pygame!

# Why make this?

I Made this project to demonstrate the basics of Linear Algebra (And other advanced math topics) in a simple way through python.

Hopefully, someone could use this repositiory to look how math actually works in a regular 3D Application.
